# catcrud
text based interface, used python3 x SQLite, run cat_crud.py and follow menu shown and instructions to preform CRUD operations. To start, choose which number you want to execute.

Option 1: To create a new cat, select 1 from the menu and follow the prompts to enter the cat's name and breed. Option 2: To view existing cats, select 2 from the menu. This will display all the cats currently stored in the database. Option 3: To update a cat's information, select 3 from the menu. You'll be asked to enter the name of the cat you want to update, followed by the new breed. Option 4: To delete a cat, select 4 from the menu. Enter the name of the cat you wish to delete. Option 5: To exit the application, select 5 from the menu. I used fufu(my cats name) and shorthair.
